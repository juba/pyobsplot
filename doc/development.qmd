## Install from git

To install `pyobsplot` from git:

```sh 
pip install git+https://github.com/juba/pyobsplot.git
```

To install `pyobsplot` npm package from git:

```sh
npm install 'https://gitpkg.now.sh/juba/pyobsplot/packages/pyobsplot-js?main'
```

## Install fom source

If you want to build `pyobsplot` from source, you'll have to follow these steps:

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) dependency management system
- Clone the [pyobsplot](https://github.com/juba/pyobsplot) repository
- Install Python and Python dependencies with : `uv sync`
- Install `pyobsplot-js` JavaScript dependencies with : `npm install --workspaces`
- Install `pyobsplot` dependencies with : `npm install`

The `widget` renderer uses the [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev) Jupyter widget framework. Python source code is in `src/pyobsplot/widget.py`. JavaScript and CSS source code are in `js/` and `css/`.

The `jsdom` renderer is provided by the `pyobsplot-js` npm package whose source is in `packages/pyobsplot-js`. Python source code is in `src/pyobsplot/jsdom.py`.

## Widget JavaScript modification and bundling

Each time the widget JavaScript or CSS code is modified in the `js/` or  `css/` directories, it must be bundled with one of the following commands in `pyobsplot`:

```sh
# Bundle only once
npm run bundle
# Bundle and watch for code change
npm run watch
```

The result is put into `src/pyobsplot/static`. 

## Tests

To run Python tests, use:

```sh
npm run test
```

To run JavaScript tests, use:

```sh
npm run test --workspaces
```

## Debug mode

"Debug mode" outputs the computed JavaScript plot structure (the one passed to `Plot.plot`).

To activate it, add `debug=True` when using `Plot.plot()` or when creating your plot generator object:

```{python}
# | eval: false
op = Obsplot(debug=True)
```

If using the `widget` renderer, debug output will be displayed in JavaScript console. With the `jsdom` renderer, it will be displayed directly in the notebook.

## Documentation

To generate the documentation with Quarto:

```sh
uv run quarto render doc/
```


## Maintenance notes

### Releases

- If necessary release the npm package with `npm publish` in `packages/pyobsplot-js`
- Check that the `min_npm_version` value in `utils.py` is correct
- Change version in `NEWS.md` and `pyproject.toml`
- Cleanup the previous builds in `dist/`
- Build the Python package with `npm run build`
- Release the Python package with `uv publish`
- Tag the version in git
- Create a release on Github
- Bump to dev version in `pyproject.toml` and `NEWS.md`

### New Plot versions

When a new Plot version is released:

- update with `npm install @observablehq/plot d3 --workspaces --include-workspace-root`
- run `utils/get_plot_methods.js` to update Plot methods in `src/pyobsplot/plot.py`
