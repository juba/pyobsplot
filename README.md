# pyobsplot

`pyobsplot` allows to use [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot?collection=@observablehq/plot) to create charts in Jupyter notebooks. Plots are produced as [widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) from Python code with a syntax as close as possible to the JavaScript one.

It allows to do things like :

```python
import polars as pl
from pyobsplot import Obsplot, Plot

penguins = pl.read_csv("data/penguins.csv")

Obsplot({
    "grid": True,
    "color": {"legend": True},
    "marks": [
        Plot.dot(
            penguins, 
            {"x": "flipper_length_mm", "y": "body_mass_g", "fill": "species"}
        ),
        Plot.density(
            penguins, 
            {"x": "flipper_length_mm", "y": "body_mass_g", "stroke": "species"}
        )
    ]
})
```

## Installation and usage

`pyobsplot` can be installed with `pip`:

```sh
pip install pyobsplot
```

For usage instructions, see the [documentation website](https://juba.github.io/pyobsplot):

- See [getting started](https://juba.github.io/pyobsplot/getting_started.html) for a quick usage overview.
- See [usage](https://juba.github.io/pyobsplot/usage.html) for more detailed usage instructions.


## Features and limitations

Features:

- Syntax as close as possible to the JavaScript one
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [polars](https://pola.rs) DataFrame and Series objects are serialized using [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) IPC format for improved speed and data type conversions
- Works offline, no iframe or dependency to Observable runtime
- Caching mechanism of data objects if they are used several times in the same plot
- Custom JavaScript code can be passed as strings with the `js` method
- Python `date` and `datetime` objects are automatically converted to JavaScript `Date` objects
- Plots can be defined with a dictionary, a call to a `Plot` mark function, or with `kwargs`. See [alternative syntaxes](usage.qmd#alternative-syntaxes).
- Works with Jupyter notebooks and Quarto HTML documents

Limitations:

- When using notebooks inside VSCode, the cells output states are not saved between sessions. So when a notebook is closed and reopened, plots have to be recomputed to be displayed. This is currently a [VSCode limitation](https://github.com/juba/pyobsplot/issues/2).
- Doesn't work in Quarto in formats other than HTML.
