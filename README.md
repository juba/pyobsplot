`pyobsplot` allows to use [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot?collection=@observablehq/plot) to create charts in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) notebooks, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents. Plots are created from Python code with a syntax as close as possible to the JavaScript one.

It allows to do things like :

```python
import polars as pl
from pyobsplot import Plot

penguins = pl.read_csv("https://github.com/juba/pyobsplot/raw/main/doc/data/penguins.csv")

Plot.plot({
    "grid": True,
    "color": {"legend": True},
    "marks": [
        Plot.dot(
            penguins,
            {"x": "flipper_length_mm", "y": "body_mass_g", "fill": "species"}
        ),
        Plot.density(
            penguins,
            {"x": "flipper_length_mm", "y": "body_mass_g", "stroke": "species"}
        )
    ]
})
```

## Installation and usage

`pyobsplot` can be installed with `pip`:

```sh
pip install pyobsplot
```

For usage instructions, see the [documentation website](https://juba.github.io/pyobsplot):

-   See [getting started](https://juba.github.io/pyobsplot/getting_started.html) for a quick usage overview.
-   See [usage](https://juba.github.io/pyobsplot/usage.html) for more detailed usage instructions.

If you just want to try this package without installing it on your computer, you can open an introduction notebook in Google Colab:

## Features and limitations

**Features:**

-   Syntax as close as possible to the JavaScript one
-   Plots can be generated as Jupyter widgets, or as SVG, HTML or PNG outputs (via typst)
-   Plots can be saved to Widget HTML, static HTML, SVG, PNG or PDF files
-   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [polars](https://pola.rs) DataFrame and Series objects are serialized using [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) IPC format for improved speed and better data type conversions
-   Works with Jupyter notebooks and Quarto documents
-   Works offline, no iframe or dependency to Observable runtime
-   Caching mechanism of data objects if they are used several times in the same plot
-   Custom JavaScript code can be passed as strings with the `js` method
-   Python `date` and `datetime` objects are automatically converted to JavaScript `Date` objects

**Limitations:**

-   Plot interactions (tooltips, crosshair...) are only available with the "widget" format (<https://github.com/juba/pyobsplot/issues/16>).
-   Very limited integration with IDE (documentation and autocompletion) for Plot methods. (<https://github.com/juba/pyobsplot/issues/13>)

-   The widget is developed thanks to the [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev) framework.
-   [typst](https://typst.app) is used to convert HTML figures to PNG, SVG or PDF.
-   Some code from the `jsdom` renderer has been adapted from [altair_saver](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair_saver).
-   The documentation website is generated by [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
